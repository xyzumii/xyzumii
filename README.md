<B> Welcome to my readme. I am without a job and still in high school, </b> planning on developing in the future if things go right,
possibly creating a business or working at a business in the future, trying to afford a better PC than what I own right now.
 
 Games that are on my list to play: Zelda, BDG3, Elden Ring, Omori, Mario series, Final Fantasy series, Red Dead Redemption, etc.


I am interested in emulation.
